🚦 Chennai Traffic Predictor
📌 Project Overview

The Chennai Traffic Predictor is a machine learning–based system designed to predict traffic congestion levels on major roads in Chennai. It analyzes historical traffic data along with time, location, and environmental factors to provide accurate traffic predictions.

🎯 Objectives

Predict traffic congestion levels in Chennai

Help commuters plan better travel routes

Assist traffic authorities in traffic management

Support smart city transportation systems
